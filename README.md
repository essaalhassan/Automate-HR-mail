# Automate-HR-mail
This project is an n8n workflow designed to automate the handling of incoming company emails.
The system performs the following:

Fetches new messages from Gmail.

Classifies incoming emails (general inquiries, job applications, CV attachments).

Extracts and processes resume (CV) files in PDF format using AI.

Summarizes candidate details (name, email, phone, education, years of experience, skills, field of expertise).

Stores structured data into Google Sheets for different departments (HR, Marketing, Sales, Projects, etc.).

Generates professional automated replies to inquiries, adding the official contact email ai@woow.sa.

Sends direct responses to senders, ensuring faster communication.

Goal: improve efficiency in email management, reduce manual effort, and ensure that critical data (like job applications) is properly stored and available for further analysis.
